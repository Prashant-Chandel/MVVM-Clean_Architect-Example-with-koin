# About the Project
Kotlin MVVM-Clean Architect-JetPack Compose-Example-with- DI-Koin is a sample project that presents a modern approach to Android app development.
The project tries to combine popular Android tools and to demonstrate best development practices by utilizing up to date tech-stack like Compose, Kotlin Flow and Koin.
The sample app layers its presentation through MVVM Clean Architecture presentation pattern. 

## Architecture
*	Modern Architecture
    * Single activity architecture (with [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)) that defines navigation graphs
    * [MVVM Clean Architecture](https://medium.com/@ami0275/mvvm-clean-architecture-pattern-in-android-with-use-cases-eff7edc2ef76) -A reactive and layered architecture.
    * [Android Architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) ([ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/navigation))
    * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) - Jetpack Kotlin extensions
*	UI

    * [Material design](https://material.io/design)

## Why do we need an architecture even when you can make an app without it?
Imagine you've initiated a project without a well-defined architecture, handling all aspects within the Activity class. This means everything from making API calls, interacting with the database, to parsing data is being done in one place. Even if you've created separate classes for these tasks, your Activity class ends up becoming a "god object," responsible for an array of functionalities.

Now, your app is live, and users are actively using it. Suddenly, a new requirement emerges, such as a need for UI changes. However, your Activity class has become tightly coupled to various functions like data parsing, API communication, and database interactions. This tight coupling makes altering the UI a time-consuming and error-prone task. There's a risk of introducing new bugs while making these changes, and maintaining the codebase becomes challenging.

In essence, without a proper architecture in place, your codebase becomes hard to manage, tracking down and resolving bugs becomes a daunting task, and reusability of the Activity class is compromised. Changes to the UI end up inadvertently affecting other functionalities, creating a maintenance headache.
This is where a well-thought-out architectural approach comes to the rescue.
## Architectue
An architecture is the backbone that empowers your project to be robust, extensible, maintainable, scalable, reusable, and testable through unit testing. It serves as the organizational structure for your system, encompassing the decomposition of complex problems or systems into smaller, manageable parts, their interconnections, interaction protocols, and the fundamental principles and design choices governing the system's construction. This architectural framework minimizes chaos.
With a well-defined architecture in place, you gain the capability to seamlessly introduce new features, implement changes, write comprehensive unit test cases, ensure ease of maintenance, and promote code reusability. In essence, architecture provides the solid foundation that makes these aspects attainable and manageable.
## How?
It adheres to a set of fundamental principles collectively known as SOLID. These design principles are techniques employed in the process of designing and writing code, with the aim of enhancing code maintainability, flexibility, and extensibility. 

#### SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help create maintainable and scalable software:
-	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
-	Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
-	Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
-	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
-	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

[MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Clean architecture](https://medium.com/@ami0275/mvvm-clean-architecture-pattern-in-android-with-use-cases-eff7edc2ef76) pattern has been used in the development of this application. The development language of the application is Kotlin. Clean Architecture is a design approach that separates concerns, promoting maintainability and testability. Combining MVVM with Clean Architecture helps organize an Android app into layers like 
   * Presentation Layer 
   * Domain Layer  
   * Data Layer

# Features
-	Save Favorite Cats: Users have the ability to save their favorite cat images by marking them as favorites.
-	View Favorite Cats: Users can access a collection of all their saved favorite cat images in one place.
-	Discover Random Cat Images: The application presents users with random cat images when they open it. Users can also view these images in full-screen mode by tapping on any image.
-	Add to Favorites: Users can add any cat image to their list of favorites by clicking on a heart-shaped button associated with each image.
-	Change App Theme: Users have the option to customize the application's visual theme to their preference. This includes options for light and dark themes or other theme customizations.
##### *Note*
In this example, I initially used two activities to display cats to the user and manage adding or deleting cats from the favorite list. However, it's possible to achieve the same functionality within 
a single activity by implementing a navigation scenario for a fullView Composable, jetpack Navigation, you can follow these steps:
1. Set Up Jetpack Navigation:
```kotlin 
 object Route {
        const val CAT_FULL_View = "Cat_Image_AS_Sized/{CatUrl}/{imageId}"
}
```
replace CatAvtivity current composable method
```kotlin 
@Composable
    fun CatsDestination() {
        CatScreen(
            state = viewModel.state.collectAsState().value,
            effectFlow = viewModel.effects.receiveAsFlow()
        ) { itemUrl, imageId ->
           
               // call navigate logic here 
                      // Navigate to the full view with the selected cat data
                            navController.navigate("catFullView/$itemUrl/$imageId")
        }
    }
```
then pass this route to navigation host case like
```kotlin 
composable(route=Route.CAT_FULL_View,
arguments = listOf(navArgument("itemUrl") { type = NavType.StringType },
                   navArgument("imageId") { type = NavType.StringType }
                    )
) {backStackEntry ->
                //call relevent compose method here to display full vie to user 
                    val catImageId = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("imageId")
                      viewModel.checkFav(catImageId)
                    val catImageUrl = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("itemUrl")
                       CatsFullView(catImageUrl)
                       

            }

```
2. Migrate All Api calls from CatsDetailsViewModel to CatsViewModel .After that you will only have one ViewModel present in Application.
3. Now you have to make changes in your composable to display fullView
```kotlin
 @Composable
    private fun CatsFullView(url:String) {
        val isFavourite by viewModel.isFavourite.collectAsState()
        initialState = remember { viewModel.isFavourite.value }
        CatFullDetail(
            url = url,
            isFavourite = isFavourite,
            favSelection = {
                viewModel.updateFavouriteState(it)
                if (it) {
                    viewModel.postFavCatData()
                } else viewModel.deleteFavCatData()
            }
        )

    }
```
4. According to above calls make changes in CatFullScreen.kt file 
5. Replace topbar navigation icon to back icon when you saw user full view screen and handled this according to back flow.
 
 🙌 Now after that we have two ways to show same flow to user✌️.

    
## Unit Testing
#### UI (JUnit)
JUnit is used for unit testing of UI components. Tests are written to verify the behavior and interactions of UI elements and view models. Mocking frameworks may also be used to isolate components for testing.

#### API (Mockito)
Mockito is used for unit testing the API and network-related components. It allows you to create mock objects and simulate the behavior of external dependencies to ensure that your API interactions are tested independently.

## Environment Setup
  - First, make sure you have Android ```(Android Studio Giraffe | 2022.3.1 Patch 2)```  version installed
  - Android Studio's Gradle JDK version should be Java 17.0.6.
